# Project Description  
Death risk factors have had a prominent mark around the world. Many countries deal with similar risks while other countires deal with completely differrent risks. One death risk factor might be the most common in the western hemisphere while the same death risk factor might be the least common in the eastern hemisphere. What is the deadliest risk factor? How do death risk factors change over the years? Are age groups affected differently by risk factors? How do death risk factors differentiate between countries? For this project, we want to differentiate and compare death risk factors between ten countries that were handpicked from around the world. The countries include Netherlands, USA, Mexico, Australia, Japan, Brazil, England, Korea, Ghana, and Morocco. We looked through the data that we chose to use for this project and chose the most common and highest death risk factors of these countries. The death risk factors that we chose include high blood pressure, smoking, alcohol use, high body-mass index (Obesity), and drug use. We made sure to choose countries that can account for almost every region in the world to get a better measurement of the risk factors. We chose these countires by using the World Cup 2022 Groups and slecting at least one country from every group( World Cup Groups shown below for reference ).
